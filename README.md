## Capstone Project Overview
This project presents a federated learning implementation for image classification using the _Flower_ framework. It utilizes an open-source [Osteosarcoma dataset](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52756935), which contains 1,144 images categorized into three classes i.e. non-tumor, necrotic tumor, and viable tumor. By employing federated learning techniques, we aimed to enhance data privacy, minimize communication overhead, and improve the efficiency of training models distributed across multiple institutions.
